Hello, here is a thing that has things in it!!!!!1!!!!!!111!!1

Normal Ultimate Doodad-
- Fires a projectile. Now, what does that projectile do, you may ask? Weeelllllllllll, let me take you on a magical mystery tour of the wonders of doodads!!!!

<insert fantastic magical tour of mystery and majescticalismness here>

Wow! Wasn't that amazing!!!
Let's recap what we learned
- Projectile is fast
- Main projectile breaks into 4 pieces that deal damages to enemasos, eash piece represents one of the staves, upon tile collision and hitting NPCs
!~ Ocean piece creates a whirlpool BUT COOLER where it impacts
!~ Desert piece makes a bunch of dust clouds fly in random directions
!~ Ice piece breaks into very fast moving ice shards
!~ Sky Piece EXPLODES in a bunch of dust that deals damage like an explosion

True Ultimate Doodad-
- Basically the same thing but with some extra features!
Xtra feeturs
- Shoots 1, then after a short time of using it it starts to shoot 2, then etc. until it gets to 3
- Pieces home to enemies
- Projectiles break into 8 pieces (2 for each)
!~ Sky piece explodes bigger
!~ Ice piece makes more shards
!~ Ocean piece makes a whirlpool but whirlpool shoots corals at enemasos
!~ Desert Piece dust clouds are just generally biggah!


Well, this is gonna be fun to codez! Nothing will be TOO powerful but it'll be maybe penultimate, but don't tell the doodads that yet...
